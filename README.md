# OSB 

OSB, originally OctopusSleepBehavior, Octopus Supervision Behavior is a script for drawing graphs (mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects) from octopus data behavior. It was coded on Jupyter notebook, but it has been adapted by conveniently using Google Colab with Google Drive.

### What is Colab
Itâ€™s a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.
In simple words Colab is a free hosted Jupyter notebook with access to GPU.

* Colab stores the notebooks in your Google Drive. 
* All the files uploaded to Colab are **ephemeral**, they are **gone** after reloading Colab Runtime.
